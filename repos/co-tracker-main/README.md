**CoTracker** is a fast transformer-based model that can track any point in a video. It brings to tracking some of the benefits of Optical Flow.
 
CoTracker can track:
- **Every pixel** in a video
- Points sampled on a regular grid on any video frame 
- Manually selected points

Try these tracking modes for yourself with our [Colab demo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/facebookresearch/co-tracker/blob/master/notebooks/demo.ipynb).



## Installation Instructions
Ensure you have both PyTorch and TorchVision installed on your system. Follow the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for the installation. We strongly recommend installing both PyTorch and TorchVision with CUDA support.

## Steps to Install CoTracker and its dependencies:
```
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/co-tracker
cd co-tracker
pip install -e .
pip install opencv-python einops timm matplotlib moviepy flow_vis
```


## Download Model Weights:
```
mkdir checkpoints
cd checkpoints
wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/cotracker/cotracker_stride_4_wind_8.pth
wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/cotracker/cotracker_stride_4_wind_12.pth
wget https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/cotracker/cotracker_stride_8_wind_16.pth
cd ..
```


## Running the Demo:
Try our [Colab demo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/facebookresearch/co-tracker/blob/master/notebooks/demo.ipynb) or run a local demo with 10*10 points sampled on a grid on the first frame of a video:
```
python demo.py --grid_size 10
```

## Evaluation
To reproduce the results presented in the paper, download the following datasets:
- [TAP-Vid](https://github.com/deepmind/tapnet)
- [BADJA](https://github.com/benjiebob/BADJA)
- [ZJU-Mocap (FastCapture)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11898)

And install the necessary dependencies:
```
pip install hydra-core==1.1.0 mediapy tensorboard 
```
Then, execute the following command to evaluate on BADJA:
```
python ./cotracker/evaluation/evaluate.py --config-name eval_badja exp_dir=./eval_outputs dataset_root=your/badja/path
```

## Training
To train the CoTracker as described in our paper, you first need to generate annotations for [Google Kubric](https://github.com/google-research/kubric) MOVI-f dataset.  Instructions for annotation generation can be found [here](https://github.com/deepmind/tapnet).

Once you have the annotated dataset, you need to make sure you followed the steps for evaluation setup and install the training dependencies:
```
pip install pytorch_lightning==1.6.0
```
Now you can launch training on Kubric. Our model was trained for 50000 iterations on 32 GPUs (4 nodes with 8 GPUs).
```
python train.py --batch_size 1 --num_workers 28 \
--num_steps 50000 --ckpt_path ./ --model_name cotracker \
--save_freq 200 --sequence_len 24 --eval_datasets tapvid_davis_first badja \
--traj_per_sample 256 --sliding_window_len 8 --updateformer_space_depth 6 --updateformer_time_depth 6 \
--save_every_n_epoch 10 --evaluate_every_n_epoch 10 --model_stride 4
```

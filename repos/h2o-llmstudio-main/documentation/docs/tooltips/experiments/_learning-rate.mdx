Defines the learning rate H2O LLM Studio uses when training the model, specifically when updating the neural network's weights. The learning rate is the speed at which the model updates its weights after processing each mini-batch of data.

- Learning rate is an important setting to tune as it balances under- and overfitting.
- The number of epochs highly impacts the optimal value of the learning rate.

Defines the number of epochs to train the model. In other words, it specifies the number of times the learning algorithm goes through the entire training dataset.

- The **Epochs** setting is an important setting to tune because it balances under- and overfitting.
- The learning rate highly impacts the optimal value of the epochs.
- H2O LLM Studio enables you to utilize a pre-trained model trained on zero epochs (where H2O LLM Studio does not train the model and the pretrained model (experiment) can be evaluated as-is):

Defines the learning rate schedule H2O LLM Studio utilizes during model training. Specifying a learning rate schedule prevents the learning rate from staying the same. Instead, a learning rate schedule causes the learning rate to change over iterations, typically decreasing the learning rate to achieve a better model performance and training convergence.


Options
- **Constant**
    - H2O LLM Studio applies a constant learning rate during the training process.
- **Cosine**
    - H2O LLM Studio applies a cosine learning rate that follows the values of the cosine function.
- **Linear**
    - H2O LLM Studio applies a linear learning rate that decreases the learning rate linearly.

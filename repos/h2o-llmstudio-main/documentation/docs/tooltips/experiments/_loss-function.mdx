Defines the loss function H2O LLM Studio utilizes during model training. The loss function is a differentiable function measuring the prediction error. The model utilizes gradients of the loss function to update the model weights during training.

- **TokenAveragedCrossEntropy**
    - H2O LLM Studio utilizes Cross Entropy as the loss function and averages over all tokens (excluding padding tokens) of one batch.
- **SampleAveragedCrossEntropy**
    - H2O LLM Studio utilizes Cross Entropy as the loss function and averages over samples of one batch.

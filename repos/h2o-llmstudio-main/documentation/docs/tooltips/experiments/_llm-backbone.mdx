The **LLM Backbone** option is the most important setting as it sets the pretrained model weights.

- Usually, it is good to use smaller architectures for quicker experiments and larger models when aiming for the highest accuracy
- If possible, leverage backbones pre-trained closely to your use case
- Any huggingface model can be used here (not limited to the ones in the dropdown list)
